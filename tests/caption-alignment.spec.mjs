/**
 * DAY-166. Regression guard for the hero-captions alignment
 * invariant.
 *
 * ## What this test defends
 *
 * The hero has three narrative captions — "Your day is scattered…",
 * "Dayseam pulls every fragment…", "And writes you the report…" —
 * that crossfade in place over the same viewport location as the
 * user scrolls. The only way that crossfade reads as a crossfade
 * (rather than three lines of text stacking or sliding past each
 * other) is if all three captions occupy exactly the same rendered
 * position.
 *
 * The bug this test exists to catch was a subtle one: captions 2
 * and 3 were marked `position: absolute` with `inset-x-0` but no
 * `top` or `bottom` offset. CSS treats absolute elements with no
 * vertical offsets as "render at your static-flow position, just
 * pulled out of the flow for stacking purposes". Which means
 * caption 2 rendered where it *would* have appeared if it were in
 * flow — i.e. below caption 1 — and caption 3 below caption 2.
 * On a 1440×900 viewport caption 1 was at y≈836 and caption 3
 * was at y≈900, a full caption-height below. Visible immediately
 * in the act-3 screenshot; invisible to anyone reading the CSS
 * unless they already knew the trap.
 *
 * The fix is `top-0` on captions 2 and 3 (and `px-6` moved onto
 * each caption instead of the container, so absolute captions
 * don't stretch 48px wider than the in-flow one). The fix is one
 * Tailwind class, which makes it trivial to lose during a
 * refactor — exactly the shape of regression a smoke test should
 * defend.
 *
 * ## What we measure
 *
 * Each caption carries a `data-caption="act1|act2|act3"` attribute.
 * We query all three, read `getBoundingClientRect().top`, and
 * assert they collapse to a single value at every viewport
 * width we care about.
 *
 * We accept a ±1px tolerance because browsers can subpixel-render
 * a text baseline differently between elements when the computed
 * font metrics round off — Chromium has historically reported
 * 836.0 vs 836.5 on the same nominal line. Anything beyond 2px
 * indicates a real alignment regression, not rounding noise.
 *
 * ## How to run
 *
 *   # from this repo's root (dayseam.github.io)
 *   pnpm install
 *   pnpm exec playwright install chromium  # one-time, browser binary
 *   pnpm build
 *   pnpm preview &                         # serves ./dist on :4321
 *   pnpm test:caption-alignment            # runs this script
 *
 * The harness reads the preview URL from `WEBSITE_URL` if set, and
 * falls back to `http://localhost:4321` (the default `pnpm preview`
 * port). Override the env var to point at a deployed preview if you
 * want to defend the invariant against the served HTML rather than
 * a local build:
 *
 *   WEBSITE_URL=https://dayseam.github.io pnpm test:caption-alignment
 *
 * Exit code 0 means every caption is aligned on every viewport.
 * Any non-zero exit means a caption drifted; the failing message
 * prints the viewport, the three `top` values, and their spread.
 *
 * This test is intentionally standalone Node — not wired into
 * `@playwright/test` fixtures — because it checks one invariant
 * and does not justify the machinery of a full Playwright test
 * harness. If we grow a second browser-level test we should
 * upgrade to a proper test runner; until then this stays
 * minimal and unambiguous.
